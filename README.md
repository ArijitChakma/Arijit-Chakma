Summary:
A Bluetooth car controlled by an IOS app named BitBlue. Sound-sensitive LED strips are attached at the bottom of the car which heightens the artistic value of the car. The car is powered by 6 AA Batteries and two 9V batteries. 
  The AA batteries are connected to the Arduino board and the 9V batteries are connected to a dual H-Bridge motor driver which is used to control the speed and direction of the motors used. A piece of plywood is used as the primary base for the car. A speaker is attached to the board as a replacement for the sound system of a real car which is used to trigger the sound sensitivity. a real
